I'm Dr Carrie Baker, a Chartered Clinical Psychologist with over 25 years of experience, offering compassionate, evidence-based therapy from my private practice in Cambridge.

I work with adults experiencing a wide range of emotional and mental health challenges, including anxiety, depression, trauma, and low self-esteem. I provide a safe and confidential space to explore your difficulties and work towards meaningful change.

You are welcome to get in touch directly, and I also accept referrals from GPs and other healthcare professionals. Iâ€™m registered with Bupa.

My therapeutic approach is integrative and tailored to each individual, and I have specialist training in Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT) and Eye Movement Desensitisation & Reprocessing (EMDR).

I also draw on other therapeutic models, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT) and mindfulness approaches.

I offer clinical supervision to qualified clinical psychologists.
