Your privacy is treated with the utmost care, in line with guidelines from the Information Commissionerâ€™s Office (ICO).

* I keep handwritten notes to support our sessions. These are stored securely in a locked filing cabinet and retained for seven years before being confidentially shredded.
* Psychological reports, letters, and emails are stored on a password-protected laptop, which is also kept securely when not in use.
* Occasionally, it may be helpful to share information with your GP or other professionals. I will always discuss this with you first.
* Confidentiality may only be broken without your consent if there is a serious concern about harm to yourself or others, or if required by law. In such cases, I will inform you beforehand whenever possible.
* Your personal data will only be used for assessment and therapy purposes unless you give explicit permission for other uses (e.g. research or training).
* As part of professional practice, I receive regular supervision with another clinical psychologist. Your identity is protected by sharing only your first name.
* I also offer supervision to other qualified psychologists and regularly attend training to keep my practice up to date.
