Emotional wellbeing is central to living a fulfilling and enjoyable life. It influences how we relate to ourselves and others, how we cope with challenges, and even how we experience physical health. Yet many of us struggle with patterns of self-criticism, anxiety, or unresolved trauma that can leave us feeling stuck or overwhelmed.

As a clinical psychologist, I am passionate about helping people make sense of their difficulties and move towards greater psychological health. My work is grounded in compassion, curiosity, and respect for each person‚Äôs unique story.

I specialise in working with adults and have supported clients across a wide range of backgrounds and life experiences. My clinical career began in the NHS, where I worked in community mental health teams in Salford and Tameside, and later at Addenbrooke‚Äôs Hospital and the perinatal team in Cambridge. I have been working in private practice since 2012, which has included a lot of work with Cambridge students.

My therapeutic style is collaborative and flexible. I often use Compassion Focused Therapy (CFT), which is particularly helpful for those who struggle with harsh self-criticism. I also work with EMDR to support recovery from trauma, whether from a single event or more complex experiences. Other approaches I integrate include CBT, ACT, mindfulness, and Positive Psychology.
